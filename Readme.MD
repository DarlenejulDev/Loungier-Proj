# Loungier- Project
Have you ever just wanted to rest in the middle of your day in a nice comfy day? Have you ever been exhausted from your commute or weren't able to check into your airbnb or hotel because you were too early so had to go roam around? Loungier will help to find a hotel and book by the minute/hour/night!
